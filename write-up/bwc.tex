\chapter{Ear-Decomposition Based Betweenness-Centrality}
\label{pachorkar}
The key idea is to reduce the number of breadth-first-searches we perform;
we construct a (weighted) reduced graph by getting rid of all the vertices of
degree 2,
and then run Dijkstra's Algorithm for each source vertex $u$ in the
reduced graph (hereon $G^r$), to find $\delta_{G^r}(u, v)$ and
$\sigma_{G^r}(u, v)$ for all $v \in V(G^r)$.
We then use the information from the reduced graph to simulate brandes
algorithm for every vertex in the original graph.
