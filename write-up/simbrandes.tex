\subsection{The simulation}
We describe a way to use the precomputed values to simulate brandes
algorithm for a single vertex.
First, in simulating the forward phase, there are two cases:

\begin{enumerate}[I]
	\item
		$u \in V(G^r)$.
		Then, for all $v \in V(G^r)$, we already know the values
		$\delta_G(u, v)$, $\sigma_G(u, v)$, and $P_G(u, v)$.

		For all $v \in V(G) \setminus V(G^r)$, we look at the paths
		through $\ttt{left(v)}$ and $\ttt{right(v)}$, from $u$ to $v$.
		Then depending on the relation of their lengths, we compute
		$\sigma_G(u, v)$, and we're almost done.
		
		What about $P_G(u, v)$? We don't compute it explicitly for
		$v \in V(G) \setminus V(G^r)$, since the degree of such $v$ is
		exactly $2$, so we can check all the edges incident on $v$
		in the reverse phase.
	\item
		$u \notin V(G^r)$.
		We first find $\delta_G(u, v)$, $\sigma_G(u, v)$ and $P_G(u, v)$
		for all $v \in V(G^r)$. We do this using a \emph{merge} procedure
		akin to the one in merge-sort on the two lists
		$S_{G^r}(\ttt{left}(u))$ and $S_{G^r}(\ttt{right}(u))$.

		Now, to compute $\delta_G(u, v)$ and $\sigma_G(u, v)$
		for all $u \in V(G) \setminus V(G^r)$, we do exactly the same as
		the previous case, but with the additional possibility that
		there is a path which uses no vertex of $V(G^r)$ from $u$ to $v$.
\end{enumerate}

Now, to simulate the reverse phase, we need to traverse $v\in V(G)$
nonincreasing order of $\delta_G(u, v)$; we use counting-sort to get
the vertices in this order in $O(V)$
(since the maximum value of $\delta_G$ is $V - 1$).

The backward phase is now straightforward, with two cases:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item
		$v \in V(G^r)$: For all such vertices, we have explicitly stored
		$P_G(u, v)$, so we update all the vertices in that list.
	\item
		$v \notin V(G^r)$: Note that a vertex $w$ incident on $v$ is on a
		shortest path from $u$ to $v \iff \delta_G(u, w) + 1 = \delta_G(u, v)$;
		and any vertex not in $V(G^r)$ has degree~$2$, so this is within
		a constant of storing $P_G(u, v)$ explicitly.
\end{enumerate}
