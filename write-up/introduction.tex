\chapter{Introduction}
This report documents my implementation of some algorithms for Betweenness
Centrality.
This semester, I implemented a technique proposed in \cite{pachorkar16}
to evaluate the effectiveness of its serial version.

It should be noted that my implementation deals only with biconnected graphs.
The main idea of the algorithm is to reduce the graph size by collapsing
the edges between ``adjacent'' vertices of degree~$\geq 3$ on the same
ear, in an ear decomposition of the graph, and then simulate Brandes
Algorithm on the original graph using data from this reduced graph.

In chapter \ref{prelim}, we describe some preliminaries and notation.
In chapter \ref{brandes}, we describe the well known Brandes Algorithm
\cite{brandes01}, and in chapter \ref{pachorkar} we describe a serial
implementation of the algorithm proposed in \cite{pachorkar16}.
