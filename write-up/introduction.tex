\section{Introduction}
This documents my implementation of the Betweenness Centrality algorithm
described in \cite{pachorkar16}.

It should be noted that my implementation deals only with biconnected graphs.
The main idea of the algorithm is to reduce the graph size by collapsing
the edges between ``adjacent'' vertices of degree~$\geq 3$ on the same
ear, in an ear decomposition of the graph, and then simulate Brandes
Algorithm on the original graph using data from this reduced graph.
