I'd like to acknowledge my advisor's effort for putting up with weekly
meetings where I reported virtually no progress, and also quite late emails
and lots of excuses.
Also I am grateful to the IT department for letting me use the HPC
despite swallowing up over a 100 GB of RAM + swap on a single job.
